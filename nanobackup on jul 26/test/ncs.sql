The voltage domain signal processing is becoming more difficult due to low supply voltage that comes along with technology scaling which results in lower signal swing leading to lower SNR for the ADC. As supply voltage reaches below 1V in future technologies, improving the performance of pipelined and flash architectures will be difficult.\r\n\r\nThere is a need for  development of time based ADCs as time based ADCs process the signal in time domain since time resolution improves from the reduced transition time of digital signals despite the reduction in supply voltage.

(569, 814, 'Title:	DIGITAL SIGNATURE IMPLEMENTATION USING AES ALGORITHM FOR SECURE COMMUNICATION', 'HMS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY', '', 'INTERNET SECURITY', '4', 'VLSI', 'Description:	A digital signature or digital signature scheme is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or document. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender, and that it was not altered in transit. Digital signatures are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data. It is available in many different encryption packages. AES is based on a design principle known as a Substitution permutation network. It is fast in both software and hardware. Originally called Rijndael, the cipher was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, and submitted by them to the AES selection process. AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with block and key sizes in any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits. The blocksize has a maximum of 256 bits, but the keysize has no theoretical maximum. AES operates on a 4Ãƒâ€”4 column-major order matrix of bytes, termed the state (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size have additional columns in the state). Most AES calculations are done in a special finite field. The AES cipher is specified as a number of repetitions of transformation rounds that convert the input plaintext into the final output of ciphertext. Each round consists of several processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key. A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.

In this paper, we proposed two modified level restorers using current sink and current source inverter structures for branch-based logic and pass-transistor (BBL-PT) full adder. In BBL-PT full adder, there lies a drawback i.e. voltage step existence of, which could be  eliminated in the proposed logics by using the current sink inverter and current source inverter structures. The proposed full adders are compared with the two standard and well-known Logic styles, i.e. conventional static CMOS logic and Complementary Pass transistor Logic (CPL), demonstrated the good delay performance. The implementation of an 8-bit ripple carry adder based on proposed full adders are finally demonstrated. The CPL 8-bit RCA and as well as proposed ones is having better delay performance than the static CMOS and BBL-PT 8-bit RCA.

NoCs can span synchronous and asynchronous clock domains or use unclocked asynchronous logic. NoC applies networking theory and methods to on-chip communication and brings notable improvements over conventional bus and crossbar interconnections. NoC improves the scalability of SoCs, and the power efficiency of complex SoCs compared to other designs.\r\nThe wires in the links of the NoC are shared by many signals. A high level of parallelism is achieved, because all links in the NoC can operate simultaneously on different data packets. Therefore, as the complexity of integrated systems keeps growing, a NoC provides enhanced performance (such as throughput) and scalability in comparison with previous communication architectures (e.g., dedicated point-to-point signal wires, shared buses, or segmented buses with bridges). Of course, the algorithms must be designed in such a way that they offer large parallelism and can hence utilize the potential of NoC.\r\nNetwork-on-Chip (NoC) is an emerging paradigm for communications within large VLSI systems implemented on a single silicon chip.

It contains 480 rows of 640 horizontal pixels. Most monitors, including VGA, use a serial scheme to set the colour of each pixel. This means that the VGA controller sends the colour information for each pixel one at a time, rather than being able to set all of the colours at once in a parallel scheme. This colour information for each pixel is provided by a RGB (Red, Green, Blue) triplet. Three analog signals are used to represent relative amounts of red, green, and blue that composes the colour. However, the UP2 board produces digital signals. Thus, the controller is only able to provide full intensity or turn off for each of the RGB components. The VGA monitor does not save any of the pixels written to it so the pixels must be continuously written to the monitor for the image to remain stable.', '', 'Xilinx ISE', '', '1', '0', '0', 1),

A complete digital IC design flow will be carried out starting from Design entry, output simulation, RTL synthesis, power estimation, till PnR and then followed by a full detailed investigation on comparing different approaches involved in the design styles.

Take up a job where you get an opportunity to utilize your core knowledge learnt in engineering or diploma and you will be more valuable with time to employers. You may find it surprising but there are many VLSI positions which require software programming skills which engineers have, that go unfilled. To be precise about 60% of openings in VLSI today require engineers with programming skills. Do you have the passion to make a career in VLSI? If the answer is yes, you should go for it (send us an email and we will be happy to provide free counseling to you so you can take an informed decision) and not any software job which is not related to your engineering discipline. Remember that you have graduated in electronics &amp; electrical engineering, but software is about coding and designing software application or QA of software. Any non-engineering graduate can take up a software job with some training, but not a job in VLSI for sure.        </span></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            </td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\" class=\\"text10\\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>', 0),
