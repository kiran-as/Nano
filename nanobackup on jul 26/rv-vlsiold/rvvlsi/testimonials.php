							At RV-VLSI, I got ample exposure to VLSI technology, though I have an industry experience of 7 years. The content of the 
ADAD program is exciting and helped to fll the black boxes I had about the ASIC fow.  Learning VLSI was fun with the 
knowledgeable and friendly staff. Today I work with Intel

							I have completed my ADAD from RV-VLSI and have been selected by INTEL. But for the training in RV-VLSI, I would not have 
made it to INTEL. The training flled the gap between my academic B.E degree and expectation of the industry in respect of 
technical and soft skills

							As a student I did not know what attributes to look for in a training institute before joining. After I joined RV- VLSI, I understood the 
importance of good infrastructure, access to EDA tools and expert faculty in VLSI training, and also how crucial these parameter s  
are for transforming an engineer into a productive professional

							The industry-like setting, with expert faculty has been a truly enriching experience. The training lays greater emphasis on 
concepts and practical skills. Its been a great learning experience on the whole. I think RV has provided me a frm foundation for 
a successful career in VLSI.

							The teaching methodology followed by the faculty here is very effective. The course is designed to bridge the gap between 
academia and industry and to make one productive very quickly. With coaching from Industry experts, exposure to all kinds of 
tools, virtual industry environment makes RV-VLSI a class apart. I have been successfully placed in Cypress Semiconductors as 
CAD engineer.  RV-VLSI is more of a learning and design center than a training institute.

							 I joined the embedded systems course at RV-VLSI because I know that the embedded industry is here to stay. The course is 
unique and covers the latest industry trends, besides providing insights into the working of companies in the embedded systems 
domain. I have gained much from the course

							I always wanted to do a PG course in embedded systems. I came to know about the Advanced Diploma in Embedded systems 
offered by RV-VLSI and  was inspired by the course details. I have learned a lot from this course and we got hands-on practical 
training. I feel very happy that I am one of the fortunate persons to do the embedded course which has helped me get a job

							I found the frst Boot camp to be very interesting. The information content was very good.  Now I can relate to fundamental 
concepts when dealing with circuits. I can distinguish between FPGA, ASIC & DIGITAL ANALOG VLSI; know the importance of 
subjects like logic design, Verilog and more so - how to choose a career. I’m  looking forward to attend the next boot camp on 
logic design

						I feel your idea of a boot camp was an amazing and an extremely useful creation. I personally feel I have gained a lot of 
information in the feld of VLSI. This initiative by RV-VLSI has helped us know what is required - to bridge the gap between our 
knowledge and industry requirements

							As a parent I was concerned about the future of my daughter Prathibha. who is an intelligent student, but somehow had got demotivated, and had lost interest in her engineering course. I approached Mr. Venkatesh Prasad, C.E.O of RV-VLSI design centre, our sister institution, to admit Prathibha to the Advanced Diploma in ASIC Design [ADAD] program, with an assurance that Prathibha will be an asset to the industry in due course. I am happy to state that today her life has undergone a complete transformation, after the professional industry oriented training in a world class infrastructure, supported by industry accepted courseware and industry experienced faculty. She has secured a career placement in Intel Corp. and has brought good name to her college and her family. I was very happy to know that each teacher gave personal attention and especially the C.E.O took individual care of students. He guided them during the course and in the placement too.

I strongly recommend RV-VLSI Design centre to all students seeking a secure career in VLSI / Embedded Systems, and request parents to support their ward's decision to carve out a successful career.

							I have known Mr.Venkatesh Prasad, the CEO of RV-VLSI Design Centre, from his days at BEL where he worked as IC Design Engineer in the IC-CAD. He is highly dedicated, self motivated, has a passion for VLSI design & sharing his knowledge through teaching. This attitude is reflected in the manner in which VLSI training is imparted by RV-VLSI Design Centre. With his vast experience in India & abroad, he has set up a VLSI Design Centre of International Calibre, along with his dedicated team of faculty members who have hands-on experience in the field & excellent infrastructure with well equipped state-of-the-art lab facility.

My daughter, Meera A.Kumar, undertook the ADAD program & is now working at SYNOPSYS, Bangalore. I am convinced that but for the dedicated hands-on training at the RV-VLSI Design Centre, she would not have made it to SYNOPSYS.

I whole heartedly wish all the best to Mr.Venkatesh Prasad & his dedicated team at the RV-VLSI Design Centre in their future endeavors.
