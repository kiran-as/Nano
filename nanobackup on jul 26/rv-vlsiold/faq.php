New players will enter the market -place, new opportunities will be created and the economy will start to grow.

In the US people enroll into industry oriented programs during such periods to retrain and update their skills. Companies hire trained talent that can be productive quickly. RV-VLSI programs are designed to make you productive in a short time. Enquiries from companies for trained talent has been steadily rising at RV-VLSI.

They may be classified as product companies, service providers who hire well qualified talent and depute them to work on design projects of their customers; and EDA companies who design software which is used by product companies to design chips. Further companies differ in size; some are small start ups, some are small companies in niche areas whereas others are medium or large companies. Major world renowned VLSI companies have their operations in India and particularly concentrated in Bangalore in a big way.

                                        <span class="text10">VLSI offers great opportunities in chip design in the areas of ASIC, FPGA design and Custom Layout design. The job opportunities are in Front End- RTL design and Coding, Verification, synthesis, Implementation, Static Time Analysis, and Design for Test. The Back End jobs are - Physical design, Custom Layout, Place and Route. About 120 VLSI companies operate in India and the number is growing. These companies are concentrated in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Noida. Other cities such as Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Mumbai, Cochin are fast catching up.

Take up a job where you get an opportunity to utilize your core knowledge learnt in engineering or diploma and you will be more valuable with time to employers. You may find it surprising but there are many VLSI positions which require software programming skills which engineers have, that go unfilled. To be precise about 60% of openings in VLSI today require engineers with programming skills. Do you have the passion to make a career in VLSI? If the answer is yes, you should go for it (send us an email and we will be happy to provide free counseling to you so you can take an informed decision) and not any software job which is not related to your engineering discipline. Remember that you have graduated in electronics & electrical engineering, but software is about coding and designing software application or QA of software. Any non-engineering graduate can take up a software job with some training, but not a job in VLSI for sure.

being taught and who is teaching it.</strong> There are many training institutes around the country which claim they teach VLSI but limit the modules to only basic RTL design and verification. True VLSI training must cover <strong>all aspects from Concepts to GDS</strong> for different methodologies like ASIC and FPGA followed by abundant time spent in solving challenging design problems using tools <strong>The focus must be on solving problems using software and not software training.</strong>
